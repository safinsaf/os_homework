What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?

Virtual adress is an abstraction of consequent and "infinite" memory that belongs to one program only.

Physical adress is maintained by some phisical device. 
Physical memory is used by a lot of programs simultaneusly, therefore physical adresses for one program may be not continuous.  

So, differences:
- virtual adresses usually greater than physical, because usually there are not such amount of physical memory that system can refer to.
- virtual adress space is consequent for particular program, while physical adresses of one program can be scattered
- virtual adress is mapped to physical adress
